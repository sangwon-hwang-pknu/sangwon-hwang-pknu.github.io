**AIDAN** (Artificial Intelligence for Distributed Autonomous Networks) Lab is dedicated to advancing intelligent and autonomous communication networks through the seamless integration of **artificial intelligence** and **communication technologies**.

Our research focuses on a broad spectrum of AI technologies, including:

- Supervised & unsupervised learning
- Deep reinforcement learning
- AI for multi-agent systems
- Generative AI models
- Language models and representation learning

These AI technologies are applied to develop adaptive and decentralized intelligence for next-generation communication networks, such as:

- Mobility-driven communication networks (e.g., UAVs, UAMs, LEO satellites)
- Edge computing-powered IoT networks
- Integrated sensing and communication systems
- Digital twin-enabled communication networks

By embedding AI into these dynamic and distributed environments, we aim to realize communication systems capable of autonomous operation, context-aware decision-making, and seamless coordination across distributed agents and networked systems.
