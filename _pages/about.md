**AIDAN** (Artificial Intelligence for Distributed Autonomous Networks) Lab focuses on designing intelligent and autonomous systems that integrate **artificial intelligence** and **communication networks**.

We conduct research on a broad range of AI technologies, including:

- Supervised & unsupervised learning
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Generative AI models
- Language models and representation learning

On the application side, we aim to enable scalable, robust, and distributed intelligence in next-generation communication networks, such as:

- Multi-agent systems
- Mobility-driven communication networks (e.g., UAVs, LEO satellites)
- Edge computing systems
- Cooperative IoT and networked systems

We aim to enable intelligent communication in dynamic, decentralized environments involving autonomous agents and wireless networks.

üìå We are part of the **Division of Computer and Artificial Intelligence Engineering**, College of Information Convergence, Pukyong National University (PKNU), Busan, South Korea.
